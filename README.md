# Pirate-of-The-7-Seas-Game
A remake of a nostalgic game in Python (In progress)

Our uni group project of making a game in Python. We decided to build the game Pirate of The 7 seas. The game's mechanic is simple enough to build it from scratch but challenging enough for us to use our knowledge about 2 or even 3 dimensional arrays, and more.
This is an ongoing project so over time there will be screenshots to documents our development.
